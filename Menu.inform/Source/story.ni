Section - Menu rules

[ By default, nothing has a menu. To create a menu for an object, you have to call "add menu item" in a "menu rule". ]

A first menu rule for a portable thing (called t) which is not a person:
	if the player has t:
		[ This creates a "drop the (name of the thing)" menu item. ]
		add menu item "drop [the t]" for t;
	else:
		[ You can add Font Awesome icons. ]
		add menu item "take [the t]" with icon "fas fa-hand-paper" for t;

A first menu rule for a thing (called t):
	if the description of t is not "":
		add menu item "examine [the t]" with icon "fas fa-search" for t;

A menu rule for an edible thing (called food):
	add menu item "eat [the food]" with icon "fas fa-utensils" for food;
	
A menu rule for a wearable thing (called clothes):
	if the player wears the clothes:
		add menu item "take off [the clothes]" with icon "fas fa-tshirt" for clothes;
	else:
		add menu item "wear [the clothes]" with icon "fas fa-tshirt" for clothes;
	
A menu rule for a person (called p):
	add menu item "talk to [the p]" for p;
	
A menu rule for a device (called d):
	if d is switched on:
		add menu item "switch off [the d]" for d;
	else:
		add menu item "switch on [the d]" for d;
				
A menu rule for an openable thing (called t):
	if t is open:
		add menu item "close [the t]" for t;
	else:
		add menu item "open [the t]" for t;

A menu rule for a door (called d):
	[ This rule is more specific so it's evaluated after the "openable" one. The menu items will overwrite the previous ones. ]
	if d is open:
		add menu item "close [the d]" with icon "fas fa-door-closed" for d;
	else:
		add menu item "open [the d]" with icon "fas fa-door-open" for d;
	let dir be the direction of d from the location;
	add menu item "go [dir]" for d;

Section - Story

[ 

Now, there are two ways to display a clickable object (a link which will open a menu when clicked):
	- The simplest one is to say "blah blah [a thing] blah blah"
	- If you want the link to have a different text, you can use the second form: say "blah [menu for thing]your text[/menu] blah"
]
